                        <p class="card-text">Hayao Miyazaki is a Japanese animator, filmmaker, and manga artist, born on January 5, 1941, in Tokyo. He co-founded Studio Ghibli and is globally recognized as a master storyteller and one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of animation.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Miyazaki began his career in 1963 at Toei Animation, working on various animated films before directing his first feature film, "The Castle of Cagliostro," in 1979. He is best known for his work at Studio Ghibli, where he created classics such as "My Neighbor Totoro," "Princess Mononoke," and "Spirited Away". His films are renowned for their beautiful animation, deep storytelling, and strong environmental messages.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">One of Miyazaki's most celebrated works is "Spirited Away," a film that captivated audiences worldwide with its imaginative story and stunning visuals. In 2003, this masterpiece earned Miyazaki the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, making it the first non-English language film to win this prestigious award. The film's success didn't stop there; it also won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2002, further cementing Miyazaki's reputation as a visionary filmmaker.</p>
